A. Creating git repo on github & use git-pull to get the files onto local

B. Use create-react-app to create react app. Worked okay.
  1. "npm start" did not auto-refresh on changing files.
      Fixed by adding a .env file under the sampleapps folder with the env-var CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true

C. Setting up Express app.
  1. Use npm init - and follow prompts. Use any past project's express package.json to determine dependencies. Use --save & --save-dev on npm install
  2. Typically, npm start on express will not have any problems. BUT - npm run server (which is nodemon server.js) will fail.
     Why? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50965988/nodemon-internal-watch-failed-enospc-no-space-left-on-device-watch-home-u
     TL;DR: Since express-app is created after client/react app, chances are nodemon on react already watches 1000's of files, folders.
     So, when invoking nodemon for express, it says there is not enough space to watch further files, folders.
     Easy solution: use sudo -s & get 'root'. Then, 'root' user executes npm run server & it will work.
